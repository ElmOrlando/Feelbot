Feelbot is here to help.

Feelbot is like Stack Overflow for developer feelings. It's a list of
common emotions that developers naturally tend to experience while engaging
in the practice of programming. Each "feel" has a set of user-generated
"ideas" (or suggestions) associated with it. These could be voted up so that
particularly relevant or strong ideas appear at the top.

Example: A developer clicks the "Overwhelmed" feel, and the top ideas might
be something along the lines of "Take a walk", "Drink some water", or
"Review your calendar and reduce commitments."

The intention is that we'd have somewhere to point people when they inevitably
experience some difficulties in their development. Admittedly this isn't going
to "solve" everyone's problems and it's not intended to lessen the emotions we
experience, it's just meant to provide _somewhere_ to go and get some tangible
help when it's needed.

## Next Steps
