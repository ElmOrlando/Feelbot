# Feelbot

Feelbot is here to help.

Feelbot is like Stack Overflow for developer feelings. It's a list of
common emotions that developers naturally tend to experience while engaging
in the practice of programming.

Each "feel" has a set of user-generated "ideas" associated with it. These
ideas could be voted up so that particularly relevant or strong ideas
appear at the top.

Example: A developer clicks the "Overwhelmed" feel, and the top ideas might
be something along the lines of "Take a walk", "Drink some water", or
"Review your calendar and reduce commitments."
